This is a simple demonstration of WebSockets in C. It simply consists of a
server and a HTML page.

After it gets a connection, every two seconds (default) it will send
the hostname, uptime and rx & tx bytes of the system running the server
(can be the same as the client).

Build the server (make), run it (non-root), then load the HTML page
into a browser. You should then see a simple page showing the above
information updating every two seconds. Change the interface to show
stats for and adjust the frequency of updates using the 'spinner' widget.

Really simple, just shows the basics of what's needed for two way
communications.

The WebSocket protocol is defined here: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455

It also demonstrates the use of epoll(7) to handle multiple connections
in a single process.

It will also make use of libseccomp (if installed) to constrain what system
calls can be used once up and running. This really just serves as a
demonstration.
