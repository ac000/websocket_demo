This is a simple demonstration of WebSockets in C. It simply consists of a
server and a HTML page.

After it gets a connection, every two seconds it will send the hostname,
uptime and rx & tx bytes of the system running the server (can be the
same as the client).

Build the server (make), you may want to change the NET_IF #define
for your system first. Run it (non-root), then load the HTML page
into a browser. You should then see a simple page showing the above
information updating every two seconds.

Really simple, just shows the basics of what's needed for two way
communications.

The WebSocket protocol is defined here: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455

It also demonstrates the use of epoll(7) to handle multiple connections
in a single process.
